This website holds lessons for the Fall 2022 Laptop Ensemble at FMDG School and content written by students. The curriculum draws from many existing resources. For example:
* [Alex McLean's Tidal Course](http://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tutorials/online_course)
* [AlgoMusic II Using Estuary](https://pdxopen.tech/courses/algomusic-ii-tidalcycles-midi-and-beyond/lessons/getting-started-with-estuary/)
